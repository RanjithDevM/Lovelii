💗 Lovelii – Contact Proximity Detection (Prototype)
Lovelii is a prototype web application designed to simulate how users can receive discreet alerts when selected contacts are nearby. While this version is a visual and functional demo, it showcases how a real-life proximity detection system could work in terms of user experience and design.

⚠️ Note: This is just a prototype and does not use real GPS or Bluetooth features. All proximity data is simulated for demonstration purposes only.

🔥 Features
Real-Time Simulation – Contact distance is randomly updated to simulate real-world detection.

Modern UI – Smooth, mobile-responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Permission-Based Screens – Walks users through simulated login and permission steps.

Alerts & Fake Calls – Simulated vibration, alerts, and fake call prompts for safety.

Custom Settings – Toggle sound, vibration, and call alerts; adjust detection range.

Contact Management – Choose which contacts to monitor via intuitive toggle controls.

💡 Use Case
Lovelii is perfect for:

Demoing safety tech concepts.

UI/UX prototyping for mobile apps.

Showcasing full-stack ideas (can be extended with Firebase or a GPS API).

Hackathons, student projects, or early startup pitches.

🚀 Future Possibilities
Integration with real GPS APIs (like Google Maps API or Geolocation).

Real-time contact proximity using WebSockets or Firebase.

Push notifications for proximity alerts.

Mobile app version via React Native or Flutter.
